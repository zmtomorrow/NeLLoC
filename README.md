# Neural Local Lossless Compression (NeLLoC)

This is a demo to do lossless compression with NeLLoC on CPU!

We provide aithmetic coding (AC), Asymmetric Numeral System (ANS) and interleaved ANS implementation of NeLLoC.

All the results in the notebooks are ran  on a CPU of Macbook Air (M1, 2020, 8GB memory).

For more details about the method, please see paper [On the Out-of-distribution Generalization of Probabilistic Image Modelling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.02639), appearing at Neurips 2021.






## Update:
We proposed [ParallelNeLLoC](https://github.com/zmtomorrow/ParallelNeLLoC), which has a faster compression and decompression speed without sacrificing compression rate. 
See [Parallel Neural Local Lossless Compression
](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.05213.pdf) for an introduction of the method.
